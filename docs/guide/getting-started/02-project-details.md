The configuration options include the ability to select an underlying model architecture (typically a trade-off between size, performance and accuracy), add a pre-trained language model (to improve accuracy in a specific domain) and set other training parameters. Typically, these parameters can be left at their default values. Once changes are made, select CONFIRM or CANCEL.
